        <h2><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780958">Heard-Garris, Nia, et al. “Adolescents’ Experiences, Emotions, and Coping Strategies Associated with Exposure to Media-Based Vicarious Racism.” JAMA Network Open, vol. 4, no. 6, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13522.</a></h2>
        <p>This study was conducted on adolescents and it revealed that the most common negative emotion after exposure to racism was helplessness. The paper states that activism is used as a coping mechanism to combat racism and mitigate negative emotions. Other coping mechanisms involved disconnecting from media, focusing on creative hobbies, talking with friends, and optimistic thinking. The feeling of helplessness included three different subthemes. Adolescents’ concern about racism is swept under the rug as simply being part of how the world is. Secondly, adolescents felt powerless when racism was directed at others whereas when racism was directed at them, they felt a greater sense of control. Thirdly, adolescents felt an inability to change a situation, which led to helplessness. This helps my project because it shows what the most common reaction to racism is, and what people do in response shortly after.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775550/">Talaska, Cara A., et al. “Legitimating Racial Discrimination: Emotions, Not Beliefs, Best Predict Discrimination in a Meta-Analysis.” Social Justice Research, vol. 21, no. 3, 2008, pp. 263–296., https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-008-0071-2.</a></h2>
        <p>This paper reveals that when evaluating outgroup members, we rely heavily on emotions, which lead to emotional prejudices. The researchers argue that emotional prejudices predict discrimination better than stereotypes and beliefs. This shows that emotions are more directly related to what people actually do, whereas stereotypes are what people say they did/will do towards outgroup members. This is important for my project because it shows that one negative emotional reaction can hurt one’s perspective of an outgroup in the future.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229721000228">Wilson, Tyia K., and Amy L. Gentzler. “Emotion Regulation and Coping with Racial Stressors among African Americans across the Lifespan.” Developmental Review, vol. 61, 2021, p. 100967., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2021.100967.</a></h2>
        <p>This paper states that common coping strategies used by African Americans in response to racism includes suppressing one's emotions, social support, avoidance, substance use, and religiosity. African Americans’ coping strategies differ from other racial groups due to historical factors such as salvery. They often cope by valuing emotional self control and restraining self disclosure. Emotion-focused responses and strategies appear similar across different age periods. For example, from infancy to adolescence, African Americans are socialized to limit their expression of negative emotions, which continues into the rest of their life. Women tend to use avoidant coping. This is important to consider in my project because it shows that sharing one’s emotional responses to racism can be considered taboo in certain cultures.</p>
