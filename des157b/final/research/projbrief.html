        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This project will be a desktop website where users fill out a form about their emotions during and after a racist experience, then see the most common emotions inputted by other users of the site.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to show the intensity or long-term effects of racism on our emotional and mental wellbeing. My goal is to show how emotion can change over time, or show how racist events can make the same emotion present for a very long time. </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>I plan on visually implementing a darker theme, such as using a dark background, and easy to read san serif fonts. I will use red as an accent color, and change the opacity and size of certain elements to indicate frequency or importance.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>Users can fill out the form using the keyboard and hitting the “enter” key. At the end, users can hover over different words and can see them expand, or click on them to see a more detailed response. Words that get inputted in real time will start to expand to show that it is actively becoming more frequent.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to make users realize that the candid emotions they feel or felt during the racist experience are also shared with other people. My goal is to introduce solidarity and curiosity through this experience. I want users to feel like they are discovering and reflecting on their own experiences with racism as well as how it has affected their perspective on the world or their emotions.</p>
