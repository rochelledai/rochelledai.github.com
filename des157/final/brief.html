    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    
    <article> 
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The goal of my final project is to use my mother’s vintage audio collection and interactive web elements to highlight parts of her story as an immigrant from China.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p>The <a href= "https://opensource.glassanimals.com/">official Glass Animals website</a> references old, vintage, 90s Windows desktop elements. The website is designed to look like an old desktop. The desktop icons each correlate to a different page on the site, so it truly feels like you are using an old computer. In terms of immersion and context, this website is excellent. The experience it aimed to provide was clearly communicated through its visual and interactive design. All the interactions mimic the old Windows systems. This site is able to integrate modern information such as the Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram logos, while still retaining the old-school vibes of a PC. In terms of accessibility, the site could be improved. Since they are referencing the old design systems, the font is sometimes hard to read.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p>The Genius website shares similar content as my project because it is a music platform, where people can read news about the latest music releases, or learn more about a songs’ meaning(s). Genius displays song lyrics and lets users play audio all on the same page. It also displays an album cover for each song. However, Genius’ main goal is to let users click on certain lyrics to learn more about what it means. Genius does not focus on the visual elements or design of the album cover, and instead emphasizes functionality. Clicking the lyric reveals hidden annotations. This type of interactive design saves a lot of space and prevents the user from benign overloaded with information.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>Unlike the previous projects, my goal is not to simply play sound or present an audio collection. My goal is to present a story, or a small peek into my mom’s journey as an immigrant from China, and her life in America. Therefore, I plan on providing context about the audio tapes, such as translations, the time they were made, and why my mom kept the tapes. Similar to the Glass Animals website, my goal is to recreate a nostalgic experience; I want it to feel like the user is looking at my living room table and exploring all the different cassettes. Glass Animals accurately captures the old Windows PC vibes through its visual design. Likewise, I want to provide visual cues to communicate the physical context of my site. </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>I plan on incorporating a red and pink color scheme, with accents of bright blue, to communicate the vintage vibe found on older Chinese product packaging. To continue the theme of vintage, older aesthetics, I plan on using a monospace typeface that mimics the font used on old cassette players. Chinese fonts will also be explored to further unify the overarching vintage theme. I want to display the objects/images in a loose manner that utilizes gestalt’s principle of movement. Ideally, the objects will seem to be laid out naturally on a table. The background image will have a soft texture similar to a table to further emphasize the context.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>When users hover over objects, the objects will enlarge slightly. Once the user clicks on the object, the page will be animated so that it feels like the window is zooming in on that specific object. The object will enlarge slightly and shift towards the left half of the screen. On the right of the object will be the text and information about the object. When users hover over the object, their cursor will change into a “play” icon. Once the object is clicked, the cursor will animate so that a circle is being drawn around in the “play” icon. The speed of the circle animation will correlate to the length of the audio. While the audio plays, the cursor will also display a “pause” symbol so that users can simply click the object again to stop the music. To the right of the object, text information will be displayed, such as the title, and the lyrics. As the audio plays, the lyrics will animate onto the screen.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>I want users to feel like they are looking at a table with cassettes and cds. When they hover over the objects, I want it to seem like the objects are levitating. Once the object is clicked, I want the experience to feel as if they are zoning in on that specific part of the table to look at that one specific object. When the users click the object to play the audio, I want it to feel like they are inserting the physical object into a cassette/cd player. To do this, I will add a sound effect that runs when they click play. I also want the users to feel like they understand certain parts of my mom’s journey as a Chinese person living in America. For example, many people are aware that English is her second language, but not everyone knows how she learned or obtained those skills. I hope to use her vintage audio collection to shine light on the little details about her life.</p>
